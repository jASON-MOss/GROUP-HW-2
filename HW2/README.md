This assignment was to create a phonebook out of a linked list. When you run this program, the first thing you will want to do is to enter 1 and read from a file.
In this case, it will be readFile.txt. This will be used to fill the linked list. They are not in alphanetical order to show off the sort function of this program.
For example, the first person's last name in the file starts with a z. When the sort program is used, that user will be at the back unless you add more to the list.
Another thing to note is that when you are using the lookup function to find a phonenumber, you will want to enter the user's first name. This is the same for the delete function.
When you press the option to add a new user, you will be asked if you want to use the sort function. If you want to just add a use using push_front or push_back, enter no.
You will then be asked if you want to use push_back or push_front. Enter push_back or push_front. You will then be asked to enter a first name, last name, and number.
When you wish to exit the program, press 8.
